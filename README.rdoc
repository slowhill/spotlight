== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Developed on:
- Ruby 2.0.0
- Rails 4.0.4

For websockets refer to: https://github.com/websocket-rails/websocket-rails/wiki

Maybe use FFmpeg for audio streaming? http://www.ffmpeg.org/index.html


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
